## Taxation

### Income Tax Basics
Income tax is a direct tax levied on income earned by individuals and entities. In India, tax rates are progressive - higher income means higher tax rates. Income up to ₹2.5 lakhs is tax-free under the old regime. The new tax regime offers lower rates but fewer deductions.

### Tax Deductions
Section 80C allows deductions up to ₹1.5 lakhs for investments in PPF, ELSS, life insurance premiums, and home loan principal. Section 80D covers health insurance premiums up to ₹25,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens).

### Capital Gains Tax
Short-term capital gains (STCG) on equity held less than 1 year are taxed at 15%. Long-term capital gains (LTCG) above ₹1 lakh are taxed at 10% without indexation.

## Mutual Funds

### What are Mutual Funds
Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Professional fund managers make investment decisions.

### Types of Mutual Funds
- Equity Funds: Invest primarily in stocks, higher risk and returns
- Debt Funds: Invest in fixed-income securities, lower risk
- Hybrid Funds: Mix of equity and debt
- ELSS: Equity Linked Savings Scheme with 3-year lock-in and tax benefits under 80C

### SIP vs Lumpsum
SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) allows regular small investments, reduces timing risk through rupee cost averaging. Lumpsum is one-time investment, suitable when you have a large amount.

### Mutual Fund Returns
Past returns don't guarantee future performance. Equity funds historically give 12-15% returns long-term. Debt funds give 6-8%. Consider expense ratio - lower is better.

## Insurance

### Life Insurance
Term insurance provides pure protection at low cost. Endowment plans mix insurance with savings. ULIPs combine insurance and investment. Term insurance is recommended for pure protection needs.

### Health Insurance
Covers hospitalization expenses. Family floater plans cover entire family. Critical illness riders provide lump sum for serious diseases. Adequate coverage is ₹5-10 lakhs minimum per person.

### Insurance Premium Calculation
Life insurance premium depends on age, health, sum assured, and policy term. Buy early for lower premiums. Health insurance premiums increase with age.

## Government Schemes

## Equity Market

### Stock Market Basics
Stocks represent ownership in companies. BSE and NSE are major Indian exchanges. Stocks offer high returns but high risk. Diversification is important.

### Long-term vs Short-term
Long-term investing (5+ years) reduces risk and benefits from compounding. Short-term trading is riskier and requires expertise.

### Dividend vs Growth
Dividend stocks provide regular income. Growth stocks reinvest profits for capital appreciation. Choice depends on investment goals.

## Government Bonds

### Types of Bonds
Government securities (G-Secs) are safest with sovereign guarantee. Corporate bonds offer higher yields but carry credit risk. Tax-free bonds available for specific infrastructure projects.

### Bond Returns
Bond yields move inverse to prices. Long-duration bonds are more volatile. Government bonds typically yield 6-7%.

## Investment Strategy

### Asset Allocation
Diversify across asset classes based on age and risk appetite. Common formula: Equity% = 100 - age. Rebalance annually.

### Risk Profile
Aggressive investors can take 70-80% equity. Conservative investors should limit equity to 20-30%. Moderate investors can have 50% equity.

### Emergency Fund
Maintain 6 months of expenses in liquid funds or savings account before investing. This prevents premature withdrawal of investments.

### Investment Duration
Short-term (< 3 years): Debt funds, FDs
Medium-term (3-5 years): Balanced funds, debt funds
Long-term (5+ years): Equity funds, stocks, PPF

### Investment Goals
Retirement planning: Start early, invest in equity for long-term
Child education: Plan 15-20 years ahead, use mix of equity and debt
Home purchase: Medium to long-term, progressive debt allocation
